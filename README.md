Subject: Leave Request - Yiheng Ruan (Feb 2 - Feb 26)
​Dear Bingcan,
​I am writing to formally request leave from February 2nd to February 26th. I plan to return to my hometown for personal reasons during this period.
​I will ensure that my current tasks are up to date before I leave. I plan to be back in the office on February 27th.
​Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any handover procedures I need to complete beforehand.
​Thank you for your understanding and approval.
​Best regards,
​Yiheng Ruan
